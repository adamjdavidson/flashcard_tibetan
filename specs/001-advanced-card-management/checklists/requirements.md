# Specification Quality Checklist: Advanced Admin Card Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2024-12-02
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

âœ… **Specification is complete and ready for planning**

All quality criteria pass. The specification:
- Provides 5 prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3) that are independently testable
- Defines 25 functional requirements that are clear and testable
- Includes measurable, technology-agnostic success criteria (10 criteria)
- Identifies 8 edge cases
- Defines 4 key entities (Card, Category, Instruction Level, Table View Configuration)
- Contains no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all decisions made with reasonable defaults
- No implementation details (React, database types, etc.) - focuses on user outcomes

The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` command.
