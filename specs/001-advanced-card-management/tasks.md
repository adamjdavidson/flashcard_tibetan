# Implementation Tasks: Advanced Admin Card Management

**Branch**: `001-advanced-card-management` | **Date**: 2025-11-01 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md) | **Plan**: [plan.md](./plan.md)

## Summary

Task breakdown for Advanced Admin Card Management feature. Tasks are organized by user story priority to enable independent implementation and testing. Each user story phase is independently testable and deployable.

**Implementation Strategy**: MVP-first approach. Phase 1 (Setup) → Phase 2 (Foundational) → Phase 3 (US1 - Table View) → Phase 4 (US2 - CRUD) → Phase 5 (US3 - Instruction Levels) → Phase 6 (US4 - Categories) → Phase 7 (US5 - View Switching) → Phase 8 (Polish)

## User Stories

- **US1** (P1): Admin Views Cards in Table View
- **US2** (P1): Admin Manages Cards in Table View
- **US3** (P2): Admin Manages Instruction Levels
- **US4** (P2): Admin Manages Categories
- **US5** (P3): Admin Switches Between Card and Table Views

```

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Phase 5 (US3) and Phase 6 (US4) can be implemented in parallel after Phase 2
- Service layer tasks within each phase are parallelizable (different files)

## Phase 1: Setup - Database Migration

**Goal**: Create database schema for categories and instruction levels, seed default instruction levels, set up RLS policies.

**Independent Test**: Migration can be verified by checking Supabase schema, querying instruction_levels table for default values, and verifying RLS policies.

- [x] T001 Create database migration file `supabase/migrations/20251101000001_advanced_card_classification.sql`
- [x] T002 Add `instruction_level_id` column to `cards` table (UUID, NULL, FK to instruction_levels)
- [x] T003 Create `categories` table with columns: id (UUID PK), name (TEXT UNIQUE), description (TEXT), created_by (UUID FK), created_at, updated_at
- [x] T004 Create `instruction_levels` table with columns: id (UUID PK), name (TEXT UNIQUE), order (INTEGER), description (TEXT), is_default (BOOLEAN), created_at
- [x] T005 Create `card_categories` junction table with columns: card_id (TEXT FK), category_id (UUID FK), PRIMARY KEY (card_id, category_id)
- [x] T006 Create indexes: idx_categories_name, idx_instruction_levels_order, idx_card_categories_card_id, idx_card_categories_category_id, idx_cards_instruction_level_id
- [x] T007 Seed default instruction levels: Beginner (order: 1, is_default: true), Intermediate (order: 2, is_default: true), Advanced (order: 3, is_default: true)
- [x] T008 Create RLS policy: "Anyone can read categories" on categories table
- [x] T009 Create RLS policy: "Admins can manage categories" (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on categories table
- [x] T010 Create RLS policy: "Anyone can read instruction_levels" on instruction_levels table
- [x] T011 Create RLS policy: "Admins can manage instruction_levels" (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on instruction_levels table

## Phase 2: Foundational - Services

**Goal**: Create service layer for categories and instruction levels. Modify cardsService to support classification data.

**Independent Test**: Services can be tested independently with unit tests. Each service's CRUD operations can be verified with mock Supabase calls.

- [x] T023 [P] Modify `src/services/cardsService.js` loadCards function to JOIN with instruction_levels and card_categories/categories
- [x] T024 [P] Modify `src/services/cardsService.js` saveCard function to handle instruction_level_id and category associations (insert/update card_categories)
- [x] T025 [P] Modify `src/services/cardsService.js` transformCardFromDB to include instruction_level object and categories array
- [x] T026 [P] Modify `src/services/cardsService.js` transformCardToDB to handle instruction_level_id and category_ids array
- [x] T027 Create unit tests for `src/services/__tests__/categoriesService.test.js` (test all CRUD operations)
- [x] T028 Create unit tests for `src/services/__tests__/instructionLevelsService.test.js` (test all CRUD operations)
