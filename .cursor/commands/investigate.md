description: Alias for /errorcode - MANDATORY error investigation process
---

**This command is an alias for `/errorcode`.**

See `.cursor/commands/errorcode.md` for full documentation.

When you use `/investigate`, you MUST follow the same mandatory error investigation process defined in `.cursor/rules/error-investigation.mdc`.

**DO NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES UNTIL ALL STEPS ARE COMPLETE.**
